📊 Predicting College Applications Using Machine Learning
This project was completed as part of the Data Science Fundamentals course at Tose'eh Institute, under the supervision of Dr. Farzad Minooei. The main objective was to apply the CRISP-DM methodology to a real-world machine learning problem.

🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the number of college applications a university receives (Apps) based on other institutional features. The dataset used includes various attributes from U.S. colleges in the year 1995.

🧾 Dataset
Source: Provided by the course

File: college.csv

Target Variable: Apps — Number of applications received

Features: Include variables like acceptance rate, student-to-faculty ratio, tuition, SAT scores, etc.

Description File: college_data_description.txt (not included here, but referenced in the project)

📌 Problem Motivation
Why? Predicting application volume can help colleges optimize recruitment strategies, allocate resources, and plan more effectively.

Use Cases: Useful for university admissions offices, policymakers, and educational researchers.

🛠️ Methodology
This project follows the CRISP-DM framework, including:

1. Business Understanding
Understand the problem domain and why predicting Apps is valuable.

2. Data Understanding
Analyze the dataset structure

Check for missing values, variable types, and potential anomalies

3. Data Preparation
Cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering

Normalization and transformation

4. Modeling
Implemented multiple machine learning models in Python:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Evaluated models using RMSE, MAE, and R²

5. Evaluation
Compared model performance

Discussed trade-offs

Selected the best model based on test-set accuracy

6. Deployment (Optional)
Discussed potential deployment via web application or API

📈 Results
Best-performing model: (add model name and brief performance summary here once available)

Key finding: Certain features like acceptance rate, SAT scores, and out-of-state tuition were strong predictors of application volume.

💡 Lessons Learned
Hands-on experience with machine learning pipelines

Practical application of CRISP-DM
